-	The purpose of this analysis is to perform exploratory analysis on large CSV files using several types of visualizations to aid in my analysis to tell a compelling story about the data. Using python scripts using pandas libraries, Jupyter notebook, and Matplotlib to create these charts. These charts will showcase the relationship between the type of city and the relationship between the number of drivers and riders and the percentage of total fares, riders, and drivers by type of city. Ultimately this data will help Pyber improve access to ride sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. 

Looking at the images below you can see there is plenty of opportunity to expand survices in both the rural and suburban areas. The Urban cities fare is the highest and  most consistent. With the most drivers they can afford to lower the fares in an attempts to lore more riders.

- -	From our analysis we can predict that there are good opportunities to expand the business in urban cities. Lowering fares could bring in more drivers and even with lower fares the increase in the number of drives could considerably help the business.
